            Through the connection of workshop, Mongolian youths and Caritas women have the opportunity to cooperate and
            exchange. People who play different roles in the community see local issues from different perspectives and
            search for a way to improve community together.
            <br><br>We collaborate cross-border with students from King Mongkut's University of Technology
            Thonburi, inviting local residents, parishioners, Verbist Care Center alumni, and Caritas women to
            participate in our design thinking workshop at Sts. Peter and Paul Cathedral. It is hoped that such a plan
            can bring long-term changes to the local area, rather than just short-term results.</p>

          <p><b>❶ Empathize | Understand the context</b>
            <br><br>Many farmers moved to cities in search of jobs, since Mongolian had experienced several snowstorms. However, limited job opportunities in cities cannot satisfy immigrants from rural area. As a result, those who have financial difficulties gather and form ger areas.
            <br><br>There are huge gaps between the haves and have-nots. 60% of the people in Ulaanbaatar live in ger areas. Therefore, we decide to find out the real life of the local people through visiting six families living in BayanKholsuu ger district.</p>

          <p><b>❷ Empathize | Put aside stereotypes</b>
            <br><br>We learn about some background information of ger district during home visiting. However, we are still confused about more details of local lifestyle since it is really different from what we imagine originally.
            <br><br>We take advantage of design thinking approach, writing down all our questions and issues on post-it notes to clarify the core issues that attract the most attention. After the discussion with Caritas women and Fr. Joseph, we can further understand Mongolia from the perspective of local residents.</p>

          <p class="bb"><b>❸ Empathize | Cooperation</b>
            <br><br>We invite Caritas women living in BayanKholsuu ger district to share their lives with participants in the workshop. However, participants misunderstand that they are going to help Caritas women.
            <br><br>So we design an activity that different groups are responsible for cleaning up after meal each day. The goal is to make group members realize how cooperation works, which is the key point of the workshop. After a week of competing, the first group focuses on the efficiency of dishwashing, while the other groups add other organizational elements such as meal pickup process, cleaning steps, kitchen circulation planning, etc. Each group improves the process and builds advanced cooperation model by using the method of the previous group as a reference.</p>

          <p><b>❹ Define | Find the Root</b>
            <br><br>Redefine and clarify the information from the process of empathy to discover the core meaning behind it. Participants can rethink whether the issues they focus are too superficial.
            <br><br>Take my group as example: We choose to focus on the topic of traffic problem. Due to traffic congestion, odd-numbered license plates are restricted to Mondays, Wednesdays and Fridays, while even-numbered license plates are restricted to Tuesdays, Thursdays and Saturdays, with no restriction on Sundays. We find that bad driving habit, too many vehicles and bad road condition are main reasons of traffic accidents, which lead to traffic jam frequently. However, we should repeat the process of empathy and redefine to get closer to the reality. After defining one issue, keep defining another issue to see if there is the possibility of cooperation between them.</p>

          <p><b>❺ Redefine | Search out the way of Collaboration</b>
            <br><br>After redefining the discussed issue relationship diagram, each team find the place where the cycle can be corrected and further improve it.
            <br><br>Our group propose a solution of industry-university cooperation, which universities cooperate with manufacturers to allow students to participate in road maintenance projects of yurt area. It not only allows students to apply what they have learned, but also reduce labor costs. At the same time, students and residents are encouraged to participate in the community. While another group have also improved the water circulation system to solve the problem of obtaining water and prevent soil pollution caused by toilets. And some other groups focus on the topics of family care, education, family economic, etc.</p>

          <p><b>❻ Prototype | Test and Restart Continuously</b>
            <br><br>Participants design solutions that can improve the issues raised by teamates. In addition to creativity, we also have to consider the practical aspect, so the progress has been somewhat stagnant. Therefore, we go back to the beginning of design thinking process and re-examine the process of maintaining roads. After team members reconnect with the yurt area, they design another prototype focusing on community.
            <br><br>After countless empathy and re-definition process, our team members designed a community-centered prototype. Everyone can benefit through this cooperation model. And this is what cooperation means, not only helping others, but also helping ourselves.</p>

            <br><br>Each group shares their thinking process and final plan of this community design thinking workshop. Participants are also free to share their feedback over the past nine days to achieve a communication effect.
            <br><br>"Whether it is our communication with the local church, Thai students, or even with our team members and teachers, we must first understand each other, but what happens most is that we all approach it from our own perspective to understand others." by one feedback of the participants.
