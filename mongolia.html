          <p class="bb"><b>Where it begins</b><br><br>The objective is to improve the local resident’s living condition through design thinking workshop in which Mongolian youths and Caritas women have the collaboration opportunity to help each other. It was important to involve people with different roles in the community since they see local issues from very different perspectives.
            <br><br>We collaborated cross-border with students from King Mongkut's University of Technology Thonburi in Thailand, invited local residents, parishioners, Verbist Care Center (VCC) alumni, and Caritas women to join our workshop at St. Peter and Paul Cathedral (SPP) and hope to make a long-term impact to the community. In SPP, the audiences were teenagers; and the audiences in VCC were children between age 3 to 12.</p>

          <p><b>❶ Empathize | Understand the context</b>
            <br><br>Many farmers moved to cities in search of jobs for a better life. However, limited job opportunities in cities cannot meet the demands from migrating labors. As the result, those in financial difficulties gathered and formed clusters of ger areas.
            <br><br>There are huge gaps between the rich and the poor. 60% of the people in Ulaanbaatar live in ger areas. Therefore, we decided to find out the real struggle of the local people through visiting six families living in BayanKholsuu ger district.</p>

          <p><b>❷ Empathize | Put aside stereotypes</b>
            <br><br>I learned so much from my visit to ger district. However, I did not fully grasp their actual lifestyle since it was really different from what I first imagined.
            <br><br>By taking the advantage of design thinking approach, I wrote down all the questions and issues on post-it notes to clarify the core issues that attracted the most attention. After the discussion with Caritas women and Fr. Joseph, we had a clear picture of Mongolia from the local residents’ perspective.</p>

            <br><br>A total of 35 residents from Verbist Care Center and Caritas participated in the workshop, divided into 7 groups, each group was led by 2-3 students.
            <br><br>A simple activity was introduced which was to clean up after meal each day since team building is one of the key points of the workshop. After a week of rotation, the first group focused on the efficiency of dishwashing, while the other groups added other organizational elements such as meal pickup process, cleaning steps, kitchen circulation planning, etc. Each group improved the process up on previous group and developed highly efficient cooperation mode in the end.</p>

          <p><b>❹ Define | Find the Root cause</b>
            <br><br>Redefine and clarify the information from the process of empathy led to discover the core meaning behind it. Participants can rethink whether the issues they focused were too superficial.
            <br><br>Taking my group as an example: We chose to focus on the topic of traffic problem. Due to traffic congestion, the government enforced a policy that regulate which day odd-numbered and even-numbered license can go on road. We also found that bad driving habit, too many vehicles, and poor road condition were main reasons of traffic accidents, which led to frequent traffic jams. However, I decided to repeat the process of empathy and redefine to get closer to the reality and tried to spot whether there were a link between several issues.

          <p><b>❺ Redefine | Search out the way of Collaboration</b>
            <br><br>After redefining the issue relationship diagram, each team targeted one place where the cycle can be improved. The issues covered had a wide range.
            <br><br>OMy group proposed a solution of industry-university cooperation: manufacturers sponsoring road maintenance projects for university students to take part in yurt area. The students would have an opportunity to learn by doing and the manufacturers benefit from reducing labor costs. Another group aimed to improve the water circulation system to solve the problem of clean water supply and prevent further soil contamination caused by wastewater. And the rest of groups focused on the topics such as family care, education, and home economy.The sole purpose of this design thinking workshop is to encourage participants to start paying attention to their communities, on places that are often overlooked then expanding to a wider area; it could be an great opportunity to involve more stakeholders to join the exercise.</p>

          <p><b>❻ Prototype | Test and Reboot</b>
            <br><br>Participants design solutions that can alleviate pinpointed issues. On top of creativity, we also had to consider the solutions’ practicality; so the actual implementation went slowly. That was when we had to go back to drawing board and re-examine the process of road maintenance. After team members reconnect with the yurt area, they design another prototype focusing on community.
            <br><br>After iterations of empathy and re-defining, we finally proposed a community-centered prototype as shown in the figure. Everyone can benefit through this cooperation model. I believe this is the meaning of cooperation, it is not just helping others, but also helping ourselves.</p>

            <br><br>Each group shared their thinking process and final proposal at the end. Participants were also encouraged to share their feedback. 
            <br><br>Whether it is our communication with the local church, Thai students, or even with our team members and teachers, we must first understand each other, but what happens most is that we all approach it from our own perspective to understand others.
