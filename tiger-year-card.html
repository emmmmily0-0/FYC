      <p>The COVID-19 pandemic did its damage, but now it has slowed down; policies have been loosened, and people have regained their control of life. At this time, the society had entered the so-called "post-pandemic era". To me, it changed people's lives and harvested the creation of design products unique to this time.</p>

        <p>People felt insecure about the virus, depressed about life, and pessimistic about the future. Now it seems we have to coexist with the virus in the foreseeable future. I hope that people who send or receive this greeting card can shed the haze from the pandemic and look forward to welcoming a prosperous New Year.</p>

        <p>2022 is the Year of Tiger, I integrated zodiac elements with 2022’s Pantone color of the year, Very Peri, to design a New Year's greeting card with AR feature. On the back of the card, Chinese character 虎, which means Tiger, was placed in the center and covered with tiger strips. A geometric form of tiger in the front expressed carefree confidence, courage, and curiosity. It symbolized the current global zeitgeist and the changes everyone was experiencing, opening up new horizons for rewriting life and creating new hope towards 2022.</p>

      <h1>Some <br> Thoughts...</h1>
     
      <p>In the making of tiger card, the most difficult part to me was to depict how people felt under the impact of pandemic. I interviewed my families and friends about their experiences, feelings, and imaginations about what would happen next. Eventually, inspiration and design started forming in my mind. I believe that the core of design has to be human-centered and I can explore ideas from different angles.  
      <br><br>At the same time, I also hope this design will bring some joy and positivity to society. I made a feature of combining the scanning results with Artivive and one could write down expectations and wishes for 2022 before spreading the love and blessings on social media!
      <br><br>In fact, I did send these greeting cards to my friends and relatives. And their reactions were precious and touched me deeply. Many people lost contact during the pandemic, but now they were reconnected through this tiger card on social media or in person. I think that it is the power of design, and it was just one small example of how technology and communication can build a better society.
