      <p>The COVID-19 pandemic had been raging, but now it has slowed down, policies have been loosened, and people have regained their freedom moving towards outdoor society. At this time, we have entered the so-called "post-pandemic era". The environment changes people's lives and creates the design products of the times.</p>

        <p>People are insecure about the virus, depressed about life, and pessimistic about the future. However, we have to coexist with the virus in the future. I hope that people who send or receive this greeting card can get rid of the haze of the pandemic era and look forward to a prosperous New Year.</p>

        <p>2022 is Tiger Year for Chinese, I integrate zodiac elements with 2022 Pantone representative color <b>Very Peri</b> to design a AR New Year's greeting card. The center of the card in backward is a Chinese word 虎, which means Tiger, decorated with tiger pattern. Geometric tiger in the front expresses carefree confidence, courage, and curiosity. It symbolizes the current global zeitgeist and the changes we are experiencing, opening up new horizons for rewriting life and creating new hope towards 2022.</p>

      <h1>Some <br> Thoughts...</h1>
     
      <p>During the process, I consider the most difficult part is depicting how people feel under the pandemic. Therefore, I have discussed with my families and friends about their experiences and imaginations about the post-epidemic. Eventually, my mind blows out this inspiration and design. I believe that the core of ​​design is to be human-centered and explore ideas from different angles. 
      <br><br>At the same time, I hope this design will bring some positive energy to society. Combine the scanning results with Artivive and share them directly to social media, write down your expectations for 2022 and spread your blessings!
      <br><br>Actually, I did send this greeting cards to my friends and relatives. And their reaction to receiving the greeting cards also touched me deeply. Many people lost contact with each other due to the pandemic, but now they are reconnected through greeting cards and blessings, whether those are spread by social media or in person. I think that it is the power of design, technology and communication that build a better society.
