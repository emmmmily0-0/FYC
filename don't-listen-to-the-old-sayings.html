            <h1>Design Concept</h1>
            <h3>"An old man's sayings are often to be true."</h3>
            I firmly believe that most Taiwanese people are familiar with this proverb. It used to seem like a positive and encouraging words; however, to younger generations, they often ended to be trash talks. As an irony attempt, we designed a series of augmented reality effects to satirize the common remarks from older generations. When user scan the illustrations on T-shirts with the mobile phones, the AR effects will appear to show what the younger generation has to say.

            <h1>Creation Process</h1>
            <h3>❶ Illustrations on T-shirt</h3>
            We originally wanted to take advantage of facial detection technology such as Instagram filters, so I tried out Spark AR to create AR filters on Instagram. Nonetheless, it was not convenient to use when everyone wears masks during the Covid-19 pandemic. At the same time, since T-shirt was so popular among teenagers, I believed it may be a better medium for AR detection. The illustrations of T-shirts was designed to symbolize the thinking of one generation, and a series of "old man's words" illustrations were produced.

            <h3>❷ AR on social media</h3>
            Young people are accustomed to expressing their true feelings on social media like Twitter, Instagram, and Facebook. Therefore, we chose to communicate with elderly through a new approach, augmented reality. I took the advantage of image detection technology from Artivive, so that AR effects could be seen when scanning designed T-shirts. I created all the AR effects by After Effect and Artivive.

            <h1>Test</h3>
            <h3>Artivive + Social Media</h3>
            Before the clothes are printed with illustrations, a test was conducted to confirm how AR works in Artivive. The image detection worked and we succeeded in uploading works to social media. But We did find that the words in the AR effects are often tangled with the background or other objects in similar colors, blurring the visual focus. In addition, some text or images are too detailed or too thin to be presented in AR.
          </div>
          <div class="text">
            <h1>Solution</h3>
            <h3>Redesign the effects</h3>
            I bolded the text and also added color blocks instead of linear graphics. At the same time, in order to avoid the mixed up between background color and the color in AR effects, I chose solid color background for the audience to take pictures or recording videos in the exhibition venue, minimizing the problem of blurring the visual focus.
