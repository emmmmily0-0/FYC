            <h1>Design Concept</h3>
            <h3>"An old man's sayings are seldom untrue."</h3>
            I firmly believe that most Taiwanese people are familiar with this proverb. It used to seem like positive and inspiring words. However, it is really a trash talking for young people. Therefore, we design a series of augmented reality effects to satirize these common old generation's sayings today. When people scan the illustrations on T-shirts with their mobile phones, the AR effects will appear the content that stands for the idea of young generation.

            <h1>Creation Techniques</h1>
            <h3>❶ Illustrations on T-shirt</h3>
            We originally wanted to take advantage of face detection techniques such as Instagram filters, so we had tried out Spark AR to create AR filters on Instagram. Nonetheless, it is not convenient to experience when everyone wears masks during the Covid-19 pandemic. At the same time, we have observed that young people in Taiwan like to wear T-shirt, which may be a better medium for AR detection. We believe that the illustrations of T-shirts can symbolize the thinking of one generation, so we combined our themes and designed a series of "old man's words" illustrations.

            <h3>❷ AR on social media</h3>
            Young people are accustomed to expressing their true feelings on the cyberspace nowadays, especially on social media like Twitter, Instagram or Facebook. Therefore, we choose to communicate with elderly through a new generation approach by augmented reality. We take advantage of image detection techniques from Artivive, so that we can see AR effects when scanning T-shirts we designed. This is the part I am mainly responsible for, creating AR effects by After Effect and Artivive.

            <h1>Test</h3>
            <h3>Artivive + Social Media</h3>
            Before the clothes are printed with illustrations we designed, we attach paper to the clothes to confirm how AR works in Artivive. The image detection doesn't have much of a problem. And we succeed to upload works on social media. But We find that the words in the AR effects are often mixed with the background or other similar colors, blurring the visual focus. In addition, some text or images are too detailed or too thin to be presented in AR.
          </div>
          <div class="text">
            <h1>Solution</h3>
            <h3>Redesign the effects</h3>
            We bolded the text and also added color blocks instead of linear graphics. At the same time, in order to avoid the background color and the color in AR effects from mixing together, we use a solid color background for the audience to take pictures or recording videos in the exhibition venue, minimizing the problem of blurring the visual focus.
