            <p class="bb"><b>After DESIGN THINKING workshop in SPP...</b><br><br>In contrast to the previous approach of theme camps, this year's service focus on design thinking, aiming to engage with local children in a more practical and sustainable way. The objective is to accompany them in understanding the concept of cooperation in their daily lives subtly.
            <br><br>Drawing from the social design concepts learned in the SPP workshop, we put these ideas into action in Verbist Care Center (VCC), discarding pre-prepared lesson plans. Instead, we immerse ourselves in the local routine, participating in activities such as morning exercises, chopping wood, dishwashing, kitchen preparations, gardening, and play—all alongside the children. Through this hands-on approach, we observe and empathize with local life, identifying areas that can be improved. We boldly experiment with ways to enhance these aspects, avoiding didactic teaching and, instead, leading by example. By inviting the children to participate, we allow them to personally experience the underlying significance of these improvements.

            <p><b>❶ Empathize | Daily Life in VCC</b>
              <br><br>VCC is truly an unique place, there are no limitations based on language, age, or itinerary. We communicate through the purest form of human interaction, fostering a genuine connection. Within half an hour of our arrival at VCC, we seamlessly engaged with them. They have their own set of interactive games, rendering our initially prepared lesson plans unnecessary. Thus, the morning concluded effortlessly, guided by the spontaneity of simple connection.
              <br><br>In the afternoon, we decided to form groups for observing the daily lives of local children. These groups were assigned tasks such as chopping wood, tending to the flower beds, preparing the kitchen, and engaging in recreational activities with the children. This process not only allowed us to understand their lives but also facilitated a deeper sense of empathy.

            <p><b>❷ Empathize | Put aside stereotpye & Cooperation</b>
              <br><br>Due to the inherent danger of chopping wood, it was initially a task undertaken by one or two strong boys. When one of the older boys saw us, accompanied by girls and younger boys, preparing to assist, he promptly intervened. He explained that they were too young and small to handle such tasks safely. Understanding this, we endeavored to identify alternative responsibilities beyond wood chopping, such as collecting firewood, gathering wood shavings, and transporting them to the kitchen—tasks suitable for younger boys and girls.
              <br><br>As a result, when the older boys and girls witnessed the younger children finding tasks they could contribute to, they joined us in guiding and involving the younger ones. Through a collaborative approach to dividing tasks, everyone worked together, making the overall work process more efficient. Consequently, we completed the wood preparation task more efficiently.</p>

            <p class="bb"><b>❸ Define | Find the root</b>
              <br><br>Through continuous observation, we noticed that every half an hour, a child would grab a cloth and start cleaning the floor. We identified that this was likely in response to water leaking from the shower area onto the sink. Whether it was the children themselves or us returning from outdoor activities and washing hands, the floor quickly became muddy.
              <br><br>Initially contemplating creating a simple mop or exploring other solutions to make the cleaning task easier for the assigned child, we realized that even with a new mop, it wouldn't fundamentally address the issue of the floor getting dirty. What we aimed for was empowering the children to use their own efforts to improve the bathroom conditions.</p>

            <p><b>❹ Redefine | Test</b>
              <br><br>We decided to empower the children to take charge of improvement themselves. So, we placed several pairs of slippers at the entrance of the bathroom. Whenever we entered, we would change into them. If the children happened to be around, they would imitate us. Despite initial resistance, through encouragement, after a few days, the floors were noticeably cleaner.
              <br><br>As time passed, they might come to realize that with a little effort from everyone, the overall environment could improve. When it's their turn to be on duty, it wouldn't be as challenging. In mutual benefit, there's inherent self-benefit. This embodies the cooperative spirit we aimed to convey—through collaboration, each other's lives can be enhanced and uplifted.

            <p><b>❺ Final | Graffiting & Celebration</b>
              <br><br>On the last day at VCC, we organized the traditional mural painting activity that has been a part of past visits to commemorate this year's presence. However, what set this year apart was our desire to involve the children in this creative process.
              <br><br>The day before, we gathered information about the things and people the children loved at VCC. Together with the children, we engaged in painting, aiming to visually capture each child's favorite things, memories, and sense of belonging at VCC. This collaborative artwork was intended to express their achievements and pride in contributing to the environment.</p>

            <p><b>❻ Reflection and Insights</b>
              <br><br>Upon arriving at VCC, we realized that our presumed thorough preparations were, in fact, quite inadequate. The children lived their lives in an unusually rhythmic and automatic manner, making us, the newcomers to the camp, feel like true disruptors. Our perceived "good" attitudes and habits seemed to influence them in a way that required their concerted effort to accommodate us. Concerns lingered about whether everything would return to a state of calm once we departed. These considerations, coupled with the experiences from the SPP process, led us to the decision to abandon curriculum lesson plans.
              <br><br>What may seem like simple behavior was something we could only understand through layers of empathy and the SPP community design workshop. Each step in this process was not easy for every team member, as it required us to shed our preconceived notions, open our hearts, and truly understand.
