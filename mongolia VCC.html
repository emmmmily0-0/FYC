            <p class="bb"><b>After DESIGN THINKING workshop in SPP...</b><br><br>In contrast to the approach of theme camps in previous years, this year's we focused on design thinking, aiming to engage with local children in a more practical and sustainable way. The objective is to accompany them in understanding the concept of cooperation in their daily lives subtly.
            <br><br>Drawing from the social design concepts learned in the SPP workshop, we put these ideas into action through Verbist Care Center (VCC). The volunteers and I immersed ourselves in the local’s daily routine, participating in activities such as morning exercises, chopping wood, dishwashing, kitchen chores, gardening, and playing — all alongside with children. I observed and empathized the local life, identifying areas that had room for improvement. We boldly experimented with ways to enhance these aspects, avoiding didactic teaching and, instead, leading by example. By inviting the children to participate, we allowed them to personally experience the underlying significance of these improvements.

            <p><b>❶ Empathize | Daily Life in VCC</b>
              <br><br>VCC was truly a unique place, there were no boundaries between language and age. Everyone communicated through the purest form of human interaction, fostering a genuine connection. Within half an hour of my arrival at VCC, I already felt comfortable to be among children. The morning concluded effortlessly, guided by the spontaneity of simple connection.
              <br><br>In the afternoon, we formed groups for observing the daily lives of local children. I watched them through activities such as chopping wood, tending to the flower beds, preparing the kitchen, and engaging in recreational activities with the children. It helped me understand their way of living and gained a deeper sense of empathy.

            <p><b>❷ Empathize | Put aside stereotypes & Cooperate</b>
              <br><br>Due to the inherent danger of chopping wood, it was only given to one or two stronger boys. When one of them saw us, accompanied by girls and younger boys, preparing to assist, he promptly intervened. He explained that they were too young and small to handle such tasks safely. Understanding this, we endeavored to identify alternative responsibilities beyond wood chopping, such as collecting firewood, gathering wood shavings, and transporting them to the kitchen—tasks suitable for younger boys and girls.
              <br><br>As a result, when the older boys and girls witnessed the younger children finding tasks they could contribute to, they joined us in guiding and involving the younger ones. Through a collaborative approach to dividing tasks, everyone worked together, making the overall work process more efficient. Consequently, we completed the wood preparation task more efficiently.</p>

              <br><br>It did not take too long for me to notice, there was always a child would start mopping floor every 30 minutes. I thought it could be the water leaking from the shower area or the floor became muddy quickly since there were always people entering after outdoor activities.
              <br><br>Initially, we contemplated designing a better mop or exploring other solutions to make the cleaning task easier; then I realized that even with a new mop, it wouldn't help the issue of the floor kept getting dirty. What we aimed for was empowering the children to use their own efforts to improve the situation.</p>

            <p><b>❹ Redefine | Test</b>
              <br><br>We decided to empower the children to take charge of making improvement themselves. After brainstorming with children, we placed several pairs of clean slippers at the entrance for everyone to change before entering. Despite initial resistance, through encouragement, the floors were noticeably cleaner in just a few days.
              <br><br>I hope they might come to realize that with a little effort from everyone, the overall environment could be improved. This embodied the cooperative spirit we aimed to convey—through collaboration, each other's lives can be enhanced and uplifted.

              <br><br>On the last day at VCC, we organized the traditional mural painting that has been a part of past visits to commemorate this year's success. However, what set this year apart was our desire to involve the children in this creative process.
              <br><br>On the day before, we gathered information to find out the things and people the children loved at VCC. Together with the children, we painted together to visually capture each child's favorite things, memories, and sense of belonging at VCC. This collaborative artwork was meant to express their achievements and pride in contribution to the environment.</p>

            <p><b>❻ Reflection and Insights</b>
              <br><br>Upon arriving at VCC, we realized that our presumed thorough preparations were, in fact, quite inadequate. The children lived their lives in an unusual tempo and automatic manner; making us, the newcomers to the camp, felt like true disruptors. Our perceived "good" attitudes and habits seemed to influence them in a way that required their concerted effort to accommodate us. My question was whether everything would return to a state of calm once we departed. These considerations, coupled with the experiences from the SPP process, led us to the decision to discard planned curriculum.
              <br><br>What may seemed like simple behavior was something we could only understand through layers of empathy and the SPP community design workshop. Each step in this process was not easy for every member on the team, as it required us to shed our preconceived notions, open our hearts, to truly understand.
